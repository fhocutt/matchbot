matchbot
========

MatchBot is a MediaWiki bot that runs in the
[Wikipedia Co-op](https://en.wikipedia.org/Wikipedia:Co-op), a space that fosters
mentorship and the sharing of skills needed to edit
[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org). Co-op members and mentors are
identified by the presence of category tags on a profile page. MatchBot
inspects these categories to match mentors and learners, who are then free to
follow up with each other and start asking and answering questions.

[More technical information on the bot's role on English Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:HostBot/Co-op)

## Getting started

To download with git:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fhocutt/matchbot.git
```

Update `config.json` with your bot's login information and database
credentials, and make any other necessary changes (see
[Configuring MatchBot](#Configuring MatchBot) for more information).

To create a database with the expected schema:
```bash
$ python path/to/matchbot/misc/sqlcreateinsert.py
```

To run the script manually:
```bash
$ python matchbot.py <path-to-config>
```

If you have installed this with `git clone` as above and are in the
`path/to/matchbot/` directory,
```bash
$ python matchbot.py .
```
will run the script.

MatchBot will not run if the directory specified in `<path-to-config>` does not
contain `config.json`, `time.log`, and a `logs/` folder.

### Running on Tool Labs
MatchBot is designed to be run on [Tool Labs](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Tool_Labs) with an associated MySQL database.

Steps to get started:
* Make an account for your bot on the wiki you're running it on.
* Set up an account with database access on Tool Labs.
* Clone this repository.
* Edit `config.json` to include your bot's information (wiki and database logins).
* Set up a virtual environment with all necessary dependencies. Set up and activate your virtualenv with
```bash
path/to/virtualenv$ virtualenv .
path/to/virtualenv$ source bin/activate
```
and then use `pip` to install the needed dependencies:
```bash
$ pip install mysql-python
$ pip install sqlalchemy
$ pip install git+git://github.com/mwclient/mwclient.git
```
* If you want to set the bot up to run every five minutes, add the following line to your crontab in your Labs project account:
```
*/5 * * * * jsub /path/to/virtualenv/bin/python /path/to/matchbot/matchbot.py /path/to/matchbot/
```
This will use the `jsub` job scheduler on Tool Labs to run the bot using the virtualenv that you have set up previously.

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

Notes:

* The development version of [mwclient](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient)
  can be installed with pip:
```bash
$ pip install git+git://github.com/mwclient/mwclient.git
```
  The 0.7.1 version of mwclient should work as well but has not been tested yet.
* SQLAlchemy depends on MySQLdb. On Tool Labs, if you are having a problem
  involving MySQLdb, try running `pip install mysql-python` from inside your
  virtualenv.


## How matches are made
MatchBot's category-based matching algorithm is as follows:

* If possible, a Co-op member is matched with an available random mentor in the
  same category as the request (writing, best practices, etc.).
* If there is no available mentor with the skill, the member is matched with an
  available random mentor who has signed up to mentor in the "general skills"
  category.
* If there are no mentors available in either the relevant category or as
  general mentors, the Co-op maintainer is notified so that the maintainer can
  find a match manually and notify both people.

MatchBot assumes that:

* Every Co-op member/mentor will create their own profile page.
* Only sub-pages of [Wikipedia:Co-op](https://en.wikipedia.org/Wikipedia:Co-op)
  and [Wikipedia talk:Co-op](https://en.wikipedia.org/Wikipedia_talk:Co-op) are
  relevant to MatchBot's activity (queries or edits).
* Users will correctly tag their profiles with the correct categories, whether
  via manual edits or through the profile page creation gadget.
* Mentors who are not accepting new learners will manually add the opt-out
  category to their profile pages.
* That there will be a certain amount of oversight and manual intervention
  in correcting errors, handling missing matches, etc. from the Co-op
  maintainer.
* If a Co-op member's profile talk page does not exist when MatchBot tries to
  post a greeting, it will be created as a Flow board. Existing talk pages
  will be edited as usual.


## Configuring MatchBot

MatchBot keeps user-configurable information (login and database information,
text of the greetings to post, the default mentor to contact when a match is not
found, relevant category titles, and namespace/subpage information) in a configuration file.

To change these settings, use a text editor to edit `config.json`. You should
add `config.json` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid accidentally uploading
your bot's credentials to your code repository. A sample configuration file is
provided.

JSON quirks:
* JSON expects no comma after the last item in a list. If you are getting
  mysterious JSON-related errors, check your lists.
* Only use double quotation marks, `"`.

### Configurable settings
#### Categories (`categories`):
As described in [How matches are made](#How matches are made), MatchBot uses
the presence or absence of categories on Co-op pages to match mentors and
learners. A mentor may opt out by adding the opt-out category to their profile
page. Requests for a mentor are made by placing one of the request categories
on a Co-op profile page. A mentor declares their mentorship interests by adding
one or more of the mentor categories to their Co-op profile.

All categories should include the "Category:" prefix.

* `general`: The category for mentors who are willing to mentor on any category.
* `optout`: The category for mentors who do not with to receive new matches.

The following three lists contain descriptions or categories corresponding to
the mentorship skills that the Co-op focuses on:

* `skillslist`: Short text descriptions of the skills
* `mentorcategories`: Category names used on mentor profile pages to offer
  mentorship in a skill
* `requestcategories`: Category names used on member profile pages to request
  instruction in a skill

There may be any number of skills/categories in these lists, but 
there *must* be the same number in each of them and each list *must* be in the
same order.


#### Database information (`dbinfo`):
* `dbname`, `host`: Database name and host for the MySQL database you are using
  to log matches (see [Logging](#Logging)).
* `username`, `password`: Username and password for the MySQL database; distinct
  from the bot's wiki username and password.

#### Default mentor (`defaultmentorprofile`):
The title of the Co-op maintainer's profile page in the Co-op. This person will be notified if no match is possible.


#### Messages (`greetings`):
MatchBot edits Co-op profile talk pages to deliver matches. It has two types of
messages: one that is posted when a match is successfully made to notify the
Co-op member and their new mentor of the match, and one that is posted when no
match can be made and which welcomes the person and notifies the Co-op
maintainer.

Greetings may be posted on standard talk pages or as new topics on a Flow board.
If a page has already been created as a standard talk page, the bot cannot
turn the page into a Flow board.

The bot will need to have the `flow-create-board` right in order to create Flow 
boards on blank pages. This right can be granted by adding the bot to your
wiki's [flowbot usergroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ListUsers?group=flow-bot). 
If this right is not granted, the bot will post the invitation on a standard talk page.

* `topic`: Topic of the new Flow post (for Flow boards) and section header for normal talk pages. Also used as the edit summary.
* `greeting`: Text of the Flow post or the section contents. This will generate an Echo notification for the mentor.
     * `{0}`: The user name of the mentor
     * `{1}`: The skill requested ("communication", "general editing skills", etc.)
* `nomatchgreeting`: Text of the Flow post or section contents if no mentor can be found.
     * `{0}`: The user name of the Co-op maintainer
* `noflowtemplate`: Template to add a new section and notify the learner when
  posting on a standard talk page. Designed to be used with either the match and no-match greeting.
     * `{0}`: Title for the new section
     * `{1}`: Requester's name (so they get an Echo notification)
     * `{2}`: Section text

*NOTE:* All `{N}`-type text listed above *must* be included in your messages,
no matter what other changes you make to the message text. For example, a
`nomatchgreeting` string that does not contain "`{0}`" is not valid and will
lead to errors that prevent the message from being posted.


#### Login information (`login`)

* `username`, `password`: Your bot's username and password on the wiki it runs on.
* `protocol`: `http` or `https`. `https` is more secure and is recommended if
  the wiki supports it.
* `site`: the URL of the wiki the bot runs on (for instance, `en.wikipedia.org`
  for [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org))
* `useragent`: Information about your bot. When running on WMF-run wikis, it
  must contain your bot's user name and a way to contact the person responsible
  for running it. For more information, see the [User-agent policies](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User-Agent_policy).


#### Namespace/root page/prefixes (`pages`):
MatchBot operates on sub-pages of the main Co-op page and of its associated talk
page.

* `main`: Title of the main page. All Co-op profile pages are sub-pages of this
  page.
* `talk`: Title of the main talk page. All Co-op profile talk pages are sub-
  pages of this page.


## Logging
MatchBot logs information every time it is run. All log files are stored in
`path/to/matchbot/logs/`; the database of matches is stored on Tool Labs.

### Runs

Information about each time the bot runs is logged to the `matchbot.log` text
file: the date and time the script was run, whether the script successfully
edited one or more pages, successfully logged information on one or more
matches to the associated relational database, and whether any errors were
handled while the script ran.

Example line in `matchbot.log`:
```
INFO 2015-01-01 01:00:45.650401 Edited: False Wrote DB: False Errors: False
```
To cap the size of these files, a new log file is started every 30 days. Two
backup logs are kept, each for 60 days.

### Matches

Information about matches is logged to a relational database with the following
structure:

```sql
> SHOW COLUMNS FROM matches;

+------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field      | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id         | int(11)     | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| luid       | int(11)     | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| lprofileid | int(11)     | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| category   | varchar(75) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| muid       | int(11)     | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| matchtime  | datetime    | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| cataddtime | datetime    | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| revid      | int(11)     | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| postid     | varchar(50) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| matchmade  | tinyint(1)  | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| run_time   | datetime    | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
+------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
```

MatchBot's match logging is backed by a MySQL database
on [Tool Labs](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Tool_Labs).

Help on Tool Labs is available on the `#wikimedia-labs` IRC channel on
Freenode.

### Errors

When possible, MatchBot simply logs errors and allows the script to continue.
Errors are logged to `matchbot_errors.log`. They include a stack trace for
all exceptions raised, including ones that are logged and handled so MatchBot
can finish running.

The `matchbot_errors.log` file is not automatically rotated. If the file is
inconveniently large, you can compress it or delete it.
